I developed a Food Recipe app that lets users explore diverse culinary delights using the Spoonacular API. Users can easily search for recipes by categories like main course, drinks, and salad, and view detailed information such as dish title, picture, description, and ingredients. The intuitive interface allows seamless browsing and discovering similar recipes. This project highlights my expertise in Android development, API integration, and UI design, with the GitHub link demonstrating my coding skills and project management abilities.
